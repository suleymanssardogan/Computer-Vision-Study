# 🧠 Zero to Hero: Computer Vision Journey

Welcome to my **Computer Vision learning journey** — a hands-on path from **Zero ➜ Hero** 👁️‍🗨️  
This repository documents my progress as I move from building neural networks *from scratch* to training and comparing modern deep learning models.

## 🗺️ Current Progress
| Stage | Notebook | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 🧩 1 | [`build_neural_network_with_numpy.ipynb`](build_neural_network_with_numpy.ipynb) | Building a simple neural network **from scratch using NumPy** — no deep learning frameworks, full manual backpropagation! |
| 📊 2 | [`CIFAR10_HOG_vs_Raw_SVM.ipynb`](CIFAR10_HOG_vs_Raw_SVM.ipynb) | Comparing **classical CV features (HOG)** vs. **raw pixel data** using an SVM classifier on CIFAR-10. |
| 🧠 3 | [`cifar_10.ipynb`](cifar_10.ipynb) | Implementing a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for CIFAR-10 image classification using PyTorch/TensorFlow. |

## 🧭 Roadmap (Zero → Hero)
1. Image Processing Basics (OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib)  
2. Classical Computer Vision (Edge detection, HOG, SIFT, SVM)  
3. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  
4. Transfer Learning (ResNet, MobileNet)  
5. Object Detection (YOLO, Faster R-CNN, SSD)  
6. Image Segmentation (U-Net, Mask R-CNN)  
7. Vision Transformers & Beyond (ViT, Diffusion Models)

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Languages & Tools:** Python, NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib  
- **Deep Learning Frameworks:** PyTorch / TensorFlow  
- **Libraries:** TorchVision, Albumentations, OpenMMLab

## 💡 Goal
To build **a strong intuition and practical skillset** in Computer Vision — by learning, experimenting, and sharing everything openly.  
Every notebook in this repo represents a real learning step, not just a finished result.  

---

## 🪄 Future Plans
- [ ] Add OpenCV-based image preprocessing & visualization notebooks  
- [ ] Extend CNN experiments to ResNet architectures  
- [ ] Add object detection examples (YOLOv5 / Faster R-CNN)  
- [ ] Compare CNNs with Vision Transformers
